Perfect bro 💪 we’re fully ready to build your vCard now.
Here’s exactly what I’ll do and how you’ll use it from your Android phone (GitHub Mobile + SPCK Editor) and later deploy on Vercel 👇

⚙️ STEP-BY-STEP PLAN

🧩 What I’ll Give You

I’ll send 3 main files one by one:

1. index.html → structure (photo, name, icons, card)


2. style.css → full design (glass effect, background, animation, glow)


3. vercel.json → small config file (for smooth Vercel hosting)

📱 What You’ll Do (Simple Steps)

Step 1. Open your repo

1. Open GitHub Mobile App


2. Go to your repo: my-vcard


3. Tap “+” → Add file → Create new file”




---

Step 2. Add the files

You’ll do this 3 times:

File 1 → index.html (paste what I give you)

File 2 → style.css (paste next one)

File 3 → vercel.json (paste last one)


💡 Tip: You can also open the repo in SPCK Editor and create the files there (easier to edit).

Step 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to vercel.com and sign in with GitHub.


2. Click “Add New Project” → Import from GitHub”


3. Choose your repo my-vcard


4. Wait a few seconds — done ✅
You’ll get your site link like:

If you want, you can later customize:

Colors

Background animation speed

Button glow color

When you’re ready, just say “final project”
→ I’ll start by sending your first file (index.html)
→ then continue with the rest step by step 💻🔥
